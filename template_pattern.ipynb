    "\n",
    "- Is one kind of  *behavioral pattern*.\n",
    "- It defines an algorithm to execute a task that require many steps\n",
    "- It helps to redefine or customize certain steps of the algorithm by deferring the implementation of some of these steps to subclasses. This means that subclasses can redefine their own behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In software development terminology, here an abstract class is used to define the steps of the algorithm. These steps are also know as *primitive operations* in the context of the template method pattern. These steps are defined with abstract methods and the template method defines the algorithm. The **ConcreteClass** (that subclasses the abstract class) implements the subclass-specific steps of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The template method pattern is used in the following scenarios:\n",
    "    - When multiple algorithms or classes implement similar or identical logic.\n",
    "    - The implementation of algorithms in subclasses helps reduce code duplication.\n",
    "    - Multiple algorithms can be defined by letting the subclasses implement the behavior through overriding.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Let's understand the pattern with a very simple day-to-day example. Think of what all you do when you prepare tea or coffee. In the case of coffee, you perform the following steps:\n",
    "    - 1. Boil water.\n",
    "    - 2. Brew coffee beans.\n",
    "    - 3. Pour it in the coffee cup.\n",
    "    - 4. Add sugar and milk to the cup.\n",
    "    - 5. Stir, and coffee is done.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Now let's see the steps for preparing tea:\n",
    "    - 1. Boil water.\n",
    "    - 2. Step the tea bag.\n",
    "    - 3. Pour the tea in a cup.\n",
    "    - 4. Add lemon to the tea.\n",
    "    - 5. Stir, and the tea is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you analyze both the preparations, you will find that both procedures are more or less the same. In this case we can use the template method pattern effectively. How do we implement it? We define a beverage class that has abstract methods common to preparing tea or coffee, such as *boilWater()*. We also define the *preparation()* method that will call out the sequence of steps in preparing the beverage (the algorithm). We let the concrete classes **PrepareCoffee** and **PrepareTea** define the customized steps to achieve the goals of preparing coffe and tea. This is how the template method pattern avoids code duplication."

    "- In short the main intentions of template method pattern are as follows:\n",
    "    - Define a skeleton of an algorithm with primitive operations.\n",
    "    - Redefining certain operations of the subclasses witout changing the algorithm's structure.\n",
    "    - Achieving code reuse and avoiding duplicate efforts.\n",
    "    - Leveraging common interfaces or implementations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The template method works with the following terms: **AbstractClass**, **ConcreteClass**, *template_method()* and **Client**:\n",
    "    - **AbstractClass:** this declares an interface to define the steps of the algorithm.\n",
    "    - **ConcreteClass:** this defines subclass-specific step definitions.\n",
    "    - *template_method():* this defines the algorithm by calling the steps methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a first example let's take a look of a compiler. The operations done by it are the following:\n",
    "    - *collectSource()* (abstract): collect the source of the code written in a program language and... \n",
    "    - *compileToObject()* (abstract): ... then compiling it to get the object code (binary format).\n",
    "    - *run()*: execute the program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The algorithm is defined by the *compileAndRun()* method, which internally calls the *collectSource()* method, which internally calls the *collectSource()*, *compileToObject()* and *run()* methods to define the algorithm of the compiler. The *MobileCompiler* concrete class now implements the abstract methods and compiles/run the code."

Now, if we have a few elderly tourists, they may not want to go out on all three days of the trip as they may get tired easily. In this case, we can develop a hook that will ensure *day2* is lisghtly loaded, which means that they can go to a few nearby places and be back with the plan of *day3*.\n",
