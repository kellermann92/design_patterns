    "- Is another kind of  *behavioral pattern*.\n",
    "- In this pattern, an object an object encapsulates all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the following:\n",
    "    - The method name.\n",
    "    - An object that owns the method.\n",
    "    - Values for method parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Consider a use case for an installation wizard. A typical wizard may contain multiple phases or screens that capture user's preferences. While the user browses through the wizard, s/he makes certain choices. This is the command pattern.\n",
    "    - A wizard is first launched with an object called **Command**.\n",
    "    - The preferences or choices made by the user in multiple phases of the wizard are then stored in the **Command** object.\n",
    "    - When the user click on **Finish** button, the **Command** object runs an *execute()* method which considers all the stored choices and runs the appropriate intallation procedure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- In general, the command pattern work as follows:\n",
    "    - A **Command** object knows about the **Receiver** objects and invokes a method of the **Receiver** object.\n",
    "    - Values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the **Command** object.\n",
    "    - The invoker knows how to execute a command.\n",
    "    - The client creates a **Command** object and sets its receiver.\n",
    "    \n",
    " - The main intentions of the command pattern are:\n",
    "    - Encapsulating a request as an object.\n",
    "    - Allowing the parameterization of clients with different requests.\n",
    "    - Allowing to save the requests in a queue.\n",
    "    - Providing an object-oriented callback\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The main applications of this kind of pattern are common in the following scenarios:\n",
    "    - Parameterizing objects depending on the action to be performed\n",
    "    - Adding actions to a queue and executing requests at different points.\n",
    "    - Creating a structure for high-level operations that are based on smaller operations.;"
