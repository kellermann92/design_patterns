    "\n",
    "In the façade UML diagram we can notice three main participants in the pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Façade:** the main responsibility of a façade is to wrap up a complex group of subsystems so that it can provide a pleasing look to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System:** this represents a set of varied subsystems that it can easily communicate with the whole system compound and difficult to view or work with,\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Client:** the client interacts with the façade so that it can easily communicate with the subsystem and get the work completed. It doesn't have to bother about the complex nature of the system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now it's a good idea lear a little more about the three main participants from **data structure's perspective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Façade:**\n",
    "    - It's an interface that knows which subsystems are responsible for a request.\n",
    "    - It delegates the client's requests to the appropriate subsystem objects using composition.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **System:**\n",
    "    - It implements subsystem functionality and is represented by a class. Idealy a system is represented by a group of classes that are responsible for different operations.\n",
    "    - It handles the work assigned by the façade object but has no knowledge of the façade and keeps no reference to it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Client:**\n",
    "    - The client is a class that instantiates the façade.\n",
    "    - It makes requests to the façade to get the work done from the subsystems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Example: a custumer go to a store and order for something. The storekeeper (façade), who knows the storage complexity of the store, go there and get the ordered item. The client is the custumer, the store as it whole is the façade and each \"role\" (storekeeper, general employees, suppliers) that interacts with the storekeeper in order to return something to a client is the subsystem.*"
